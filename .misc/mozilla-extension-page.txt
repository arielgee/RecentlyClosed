+ Product Page Description (About this extension)
--------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Recently Closed</b> is a simple and extremely minimal web extension for a quick access to the Firefox menu items, <code>History → Recently Closed Tabs</code> and <code>History → Recently Closed Windows</code>.

A toolbar button that when clicked reopens the last closed tab or window and a right mouse click on that same button to get access to the list of all recently closed tabs and windows that Firefox stored.

<b>― At Your Own Risk ―</b>
The list of recently closed tabs/windows is saved and managed by the browser (Not this extension!) and can be increased by modifying the following browser preferences.
<ol>
    <li>browser.sessionstore.max_serialize_back - maximum number of pages from "back" history that can be restored.</li>
    <li>browser.sessionstore.max_tabs_undo - maximum number of closed tabs stored/restorable for each window.</li>
    <li>browser.sessionstore.max_windows_undo - maximum number of closed windows stored/restorable per session.</li>
</ol>

<b>Note: I wrote this in a couple of hours, and it's exactly what I need. I'm sure there are existing extensions that offer this exact functionality and with much more options. Shop around if you want or need more.</b>
